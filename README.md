## TASK

- Your task is to create a one-page application that allows an Askable team member to quickly search a location, and retrieve a list of participants within a set radius. Along with each participant, you app should suggest an incentive.
- The average Askable incentive is $75 for 1 hour and $50 for 30 mins
- This is real participant data. Do not upload it or expose it publicly
- We want you to come up with a creative solution that uses real data sources, don't just rely solely on arbitrary formulas you made up
- e.g. Think about geography, how could you vary the incentive based on the what you know about the average income of people who live in a certain area?
- Think about code legibility - we can't access your app if your functions don't make sense
- Write a project journal that describes your thinking process as you go

Bonus points:
- Include some tests for your app

## TECH STACK

- You can either use React as a Framework or go vanilla. We don't encourage other frameworks as we don't currently use something else internally.

- You don't necessarily need to follow 100% this design. We're providing it so you can have an idea on what we are expecting
